# A to-do list application
An application that helps keeping track of things to do, as well as deadlines of assignments and projects.

This to-do list application was designed with the purpose of helping everyone, especially students to keep track of their
progress in working and studying.

 Personally, I often forgot and missed the deadlines of various assignments and projects, so I decided to make 
 a to-do list to help to remind me of things to do.

## Basic features:

Support the ability to
- *add* a task to the to-do list
- *edit* task
- *mark* a task as **completed**
- *mark* a task as **important**
- *remove* (delete) tasks

## Future features:
View a list of tasks, can be displayed in different views:
- all items sorted by date
- all item sorted by priority
- only completed items
- only important items


A task is modeled with a title, a due date, a completion status, and a priority status.
